webpack < 5 used to include polyfills for node.js core modules by default.
This is no longer the case. Verify if you need this module and configure a polyfill for it.

If you want to include a polyfill, you need to:
        - add a fallback 'resolve.fallback: { "path": require.resolve("path-browserify") }'
        - install 'path-browserify'
If you don't want to include a polyfill, you can use an empty module like this:
        resolve.fallback: { "path": false }
```

```
npm install path-browserify
```

```js
// vue.config.js
configureWebpack: {
    resolve: {
      fallback: { path: require.resolve("path-browserify") },
    },
}
```
